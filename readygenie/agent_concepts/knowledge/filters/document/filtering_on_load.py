# Step 1: Initialize knowledge base and load documents with metadata
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# When loading the knowledge base, we can attach metadata that will be used for filtering
# This metadata can include user IDs, document types, dates, or any other attributes

# Initialize the DocumentKnowledgeBase
knowledge_base = DocumentKnowledgeBase(
    vector_db=vector_db,
    num_documents=5,
)

# Load first document with Jordan Mitchell metadata
knowledge_base.load_document(
    document=sample_documents[0],
    metadata={"user_id": "jordan_mitchell", "year": 2025, "status": "active"},
    recreate=True,  # Set to True only for the first run, then set to False
)

# Load second document with Taylor Brooks metadata
knowledge_base.load_document(
    document=sample_documents[1],
    metadata={"user_id": "taylor_brooks", "year": 2025, "status": "active"},
)

# Load third document with Morgan Lee metadata
knowledge_base.load_document(
    document=sample_documents[2],
    metadata={"user_id": "morgan_lee", "year": 2025, "status": "active"},
)

# Load fourth document with HR department metadata
knowledge_base.load_document(
    document=sample_documents[3],
    metadata={"created_by": "hr_department", "year": 2025, "status": "current"},
)

# Load fifth document with HR department metadata
knowledge_base.load_document(
    document=sample_documents[4],
    metadata={"created_by": "hr_department", "year": 2025, "status": "current"},
)

# Step 2: Query the knowledge base with different filter combinations
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Initialize the Agent with the knowledge base and filters
agent = Agent(
    knowledge=knowledge_base,
    search_knowledge=True,
    knowledge_filters={"user_id": "jordan_mitchell"},
)
agent.print_response(
    "Tell me about Jordan Mitchell's experience and skills",
    markdown=True,
